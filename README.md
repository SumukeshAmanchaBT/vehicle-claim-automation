# 🚗 Automated Vehicle Insurance Claims Processing System  
**Phase 1 – AI-Enabled Simple Claims Automation**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is an intelligent vehicle insurance claims automation platform designed to process simple motor insurance claims with minimal human intervention.

The system acts as an evaluation and automation layer integrated with a core insurance system (e.g., Guidewire) and focuses on:

- Faster claim settlements (24–48 hours)
- Reduced manual workload
- Consistent rule-based decisioning
- AI-driven damage and fraud detection

---

## Local Phase 1 Quick Start

Use the validated launcher scripts in `scripts\` for local Phase 1 work instead of starting Django and Vite manually.

### Start the full local stack

Run from `D:\vehicle-claim-automation\vehicle-claim-automation`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run-dev-stack.ps1
```

What this does:

- runs Django migrations
- seeds Phase 1 config and demo data into SQLite
- starts the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- starts the frontend on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- writes runtime logs under `.runtime\dev-stack\`

### Stop the local stack

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\stop-dev-stack.ps1
```

### Start only one side

Backend only:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run-dev-backend.ps1
```

Frontend only:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run-dev-frontend.ps1
```

### Phase 1 tester login

- Username: `phase1_runtime_check`
- Password: `Phase1Check123!`

### Canonical user guide

See `D:\vehicle-claim-automation\my_docs\phase1-e2e-ui-testing-guide.md` for the current seeded demo claims, click path, and expected Phase 1 results.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate high-volume, low-value motor insurance claims  
- Classify claims into Simple vs Complex  
- Use AI + Rules Engine for:
  - Damage assessment  
  - Fraud detection  
  - Eligibility validation  
- Enable Straight Through Processing (STP) for eligible claims  

---

## 👥 User Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Admin | Manage users, roles, master data, automation rules, reports, audit logs |
| Supervisor | Review escalated claims, approve/reject exceptions, override valuations |
| Claims Adjuster | Validate FNOL, review images, handle non-auto-approved claims |

All user activities are audit logged.

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 1️⃣ User Management
- User creation and activation/deactivation  
- Email-based login  
- Role assignment  
- Password reset on first login  
- Modern, branded UI  

### 2️⃣ Master Data & Rules Configuration
Admin-configurable:
- Damage types (dent, scratch, glass, structural, etc.)  
- Claim value thresholds  
- OIC excess rules  
- Repair cost benchmarks  
- Fraud rule parameters  

⚠️ All rules must be configurable (not hard-coded).

### 3️⃣ FNOL (First Notice of Loss)
- FNOL data received from Guidewire  
- Capture incident details, location & time, vehicle info  
- Minimum 4 damage photos  
- Auto-generate claim ID  

### 4️⃣ Validation Engine
System validates:
- Policy status (active, premium paid)  
- Vehicle-policy match  
- Coverage eligibility  
- Duplicate claims  
- License & document verification  

### 5️⃣ AI Image Assessment
- Damage detection from photos  
- Pre-existing damage detection  
- Number plate verification  
- AI confidence threshold (≥ 85%)  

### 6️⃣ Fraud Detection
Fraud risk scoring based on:
- Early claims after policy start  
- Location mismatch  
- Repeat garage usage  
- Blacklisted entities  

Output: Fraud risk score + explanation.

### 7️⃣ Claim Classification Engine

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Simple (STP) | Auto-process eligible claims |
| Assisted Processing | Minor exception, manual review |
| Rejection | Hard rule failure or confirmed fraud |

### 8️⃣ Automated Processing (Simple Claims)
- Auto damage evaluation  
- Excess calculation  
- Settlement approval  
- Send results to Guidewire  

### 9️⃣ Reporting & Dashboard
KPIs include total claims, approvals, fraud flags, automation rate, processing time, and settlement amounts.  
Export supported in Excel / CSV.
